  description: "The human intestinal tract is host to an extensive population of microorganisms working in 
  concert to play a pivotal role in human health. Almost every aspect of modern lifestyles can 
  impact the gut microbiota; recently diet and fitness have been established as important 
  modulators. Previously, we observed that elite athletes have significantly increased gut 
  microbial diversity compared to non-athlete controls. Functional metagenomic analysis 
  revealed this elevated diversity translated into the athletes’ microbiome being primed for 
  energy harvest as well as muscle and tissue repair. However, a subsequent 8-week exercise 
  intervention study failed to reproduce the same high microbial diversity. This lead us to 
  hypothesize that it’s physical fitness, not exercise, that is pivotal to increased microbial 
  diversity. We propose to mine datasets to identify “fitness” associated microbes and 
  metabolites and investigate their implications for human health."
