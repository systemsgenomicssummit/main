  title: "A machine learning approach to predict antibiotic activity targeting Klebsiella pneumoniae — Marina Villacampa Fernandez, UCD"
  description: "The continued efficacy of antibiotics is currently uncertain due to the global dissemination of antibiotic-resistance determinants. Without urgent action, it is projected that deaths attributable to resistant infections will reach 10 million per year by 2050. Among the main antibiotic-resistant bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae is specially determinant in human health. The main purpose of this research is to discover novel groups of predicted antibiotic compounds by applying a chemoinformatics algorithm suited to machine learning targeting Klebsiella pneumoniae. Based on the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations available in the ChEMBL database, 12250 compounds have been classified into active, medium and inactive compounds (1510, 1487 and 9254 compounds, respectively). For each one, the molecule's representation has been encoded into a set of 80 selected molecular descriptors that has been applied to different neural networks to predict the antibiotic activity of the compounds. To train the different networks, different numbers of layers, activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid and tanh) and optimizers (ADAM and SGD) have been applied. The results show that models trained with the sigmoid function are more unstable, those with the tanh function are slower to train than the ones with the ReLU function, and those with higher number of layers and units per layer are slower to train but have better predictive power. In the same way, the ADAM optimizer is faster than the SGD and seems to have more predictive power. A selection of those models show a high predictive power, with AUC values greater than 95% in some cases, when testing them."

  description: "The human intestinal tract is host to an extensive population of microorganisms working in 
  concert to play a pivotal role in human health. Almost every aspect of modern lifestyles can 
  impact the gut microbiota; recently diet and fitness have been established as important 
  modulators. Previously, we observed that elite athletes have significantly increased gut 
  microbial diversity compared to non-athlete controls. Functional metagenomic analysis 
  revealed this elevated diversity translated into the athletes’ microbiome being primed for 
  energy harvest as well as muscle and tissue repair. However, a subsequent 8-week exercise 
  intervention study failed to reproduce the same high microbial diversity. This lead us to 
  hypothesize that it’s physical fitness, not exercise, that is pivotal to increased microbial 
  diversity. We propose to mine datasets to identify “fitness” associated microbes and 
  metabolites and investigate their implications for human health."
